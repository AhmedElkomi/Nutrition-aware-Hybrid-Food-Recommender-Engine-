# Nutrition-aware Food Recommender Engine

## Project Overview
This project is a **hybrid food recommendation system** that combines **content-based filtering** (nutritional and ingredient similarity) and **collaborative filtering** (user ratings) to provide personalized and nutrition-aware recipe recommendations. The system helps users discover recipes that align with their dietary preferences and nutritional needs.

- **Hybrid Recommendations**: Combines both approaches for more accurate and diverse recommendations.
- **Nutrition-Aware**: Focuses on recipes that meet specific nutritional criteria (e.g., low-calorie, high-protein).
